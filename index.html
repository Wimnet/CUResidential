            <p class = "description-text">This project presents a new, openly shared dataset capturing real-world Internet traffic from ~1000 residential units housing university affiliates. By analyzing this unique data, we uncover how services are delivered to homes—highlighting patterns like high peer-to-peer usage, mismatches between server proximity and traffic routing, and underutilized third-party CDNs. Our findings aim to deepen understanding of modern residential Internet usage and infrastructure.</p>

                <img src="./figures/fig3.png" alt="" class = "fig3 fig">
                <p>We classify the remote hosts accessed by our users as servers, P2P users, and unauthorized devices. While servers account for 93% of traffic, P2P hosts—77% of remote hosts—contribute only 5% of traffic but 47% of total flow duration, reflecting usage like file sharing and video calls. Unauthorized devices are frequent but mostly generate scanning traffic.</p>

            <h2 class = "fig-description"> Top Organizations: Domains Hosted vs. Traffic Served </h2>

                <img src="./figures/fig4.png" alt="" class = "fig4 fig">
                <p>We analyzed which organizations serve traffic to our users and found that a few major players dominate. While CDNs like Cloudflare host many domains (e.g., 19%), they serve relatively little traffic (only 2%), suggesting those sites are smaller or less frequently visited. In contrast, Google, Amazon, and video-focused CDNs like Akamai and Fastly contribute significantly more traffic volume.</p>

                <img src="./figures/fig13.png" alt="" class = "fig4 fig">
                <p>This Sankey diagram shows how traffic flows from our residential users to major service providers. We highlight only the organizations contributing over 1.2% of traffic. Amazon directly peers with the university and carries 9% of user traffic. Netflix accounts for 6%, served through off-net caches hosted by NYSERNet, a regional research network. The remaining traffic passes through upstream providers of Columbia to clouds, CDNs, and other popular services.</p>

            <h2 class = "fig-description"> Service Usage Varies by Metric and Resident Type </h2>
            <div class = 'fig-div'>
                <img src="./figures/fig9.png" alt="" class = "fig9 fig">
                <p>We evaluate service popularity using four metrics: traffic volume, flow count, flow duration, and DNS activity. These metrics often highlight different top services—for instance, iCloud generates less traffic than YouTube but has three times the flow duration. We also find notable usage differences between resident types: graduate students favor YouTube, Hulu, and Instagram, while faculty and families use more Netflix, iCloud, and Playstation. These patterns show that service usage varies both by measurement method and user demographic, even within a single university community.</p>
