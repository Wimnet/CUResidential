About: 
1) PDF of the paper
2) Link for the data platform (IEEE, Columbia, etc.)
3) Figure 1 and 2 from paper and its description (resemblance of the dataset)
4) Analysis methodology

Data Description:
2) Metadata and data description
3) Providing access conditions

            <p class = "description-text">We provide
                access to a new residential dataset â€” we have been collecting traffic from ~1000 off-campus residences that
                house faculty, postdocs, graduate students and their families. Although our residents are university affiliates,
                our dataset is residential as it captures their activity at home, and we show that this dataset offers a distinct
                perspective from the campus and dorm traffic. We investigate the serving infrastructure and service accessed
                by the residences, revealing several interesting findings: peer-to-peer activity is notable, comprising 47% of the
                total time spent by users; CDNs such as Cloudflare host many services (19%) but serve much less traffic (2%);
                and 11 of the top 100 services that have nearby servers often serve users from at least 1,000km farther away.
                This broad analysis, as well as our data sharing, pushes toward a more thorough understanding of Internet
                service usage and delivery, motivating and supporting future research.</p>
